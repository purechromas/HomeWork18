# This project helped me to practise:

* How to work with flask-restx and make RESTFull API
* How to make architecture in RESTFull API
* How to make tables in database with flask-sqlalchemy(db.Model).
* How to make schemas for the database models
* How to unpack information (**name) and add information in the tables.
